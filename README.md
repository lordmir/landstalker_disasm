Disassemblies of Landstalker ROMs

## Build instructions

- Run the `build.bat` (Windows) or `build.sh` (Linux) script - this will assemble the previously disassembled files. If no changes have been made to the disassembly, you should end up with a file identical to the US release ROM.
- The following command line parameters can be passed to the build script:
    - `-r`: Specify ROM region. Can be one of 'JP', 'US'.
    - `-e`: Build a 4MByte expanded ROM. This increases the size of the ROM to 4 Megabytes, significantly increasing the available storage space for modifications.
    - `-o`: Specify the output ROM filename.

Note: Linux users will need to install wine in order to build the ROM. Python is required for generating the ROM checksum.

Enjoy!

## Notes on disassembly

- The [Landstalker Editor](https://github.com/lordmir/landstalker_editor) is designed to work on this disassembly. It can detect, decompress, edit and recompress the various assets.
