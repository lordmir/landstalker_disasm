Disassemblies of Landstalker ROMs

## Build instructions

- Run the `build.bat` (Windows) or `build.sh` (Linux) script - this will assemble the previously disassembled files. If no changes have been made to the disassembly, you should end up with a file identical to the US release ROM.
- Run the `build_expanded.bat` (Windows) or `build_expanded.sh` (Linux) script to build an expanded 4MByte rom, functionally equivalent to the original US ROM but with plenty of additional space for new content.

Note: Linux users will need to install wine in order to build the ROM.

Enjoy!

## Notes on disassembly

- The [Landstalker Editor](https://github.com/lordmir/landstalker_editor) is designed to work on this disassembly. It can detect, decompress, edit and recompress the various assets.
